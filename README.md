# go-cruise-control

It's client library (written in Golang) for interacting with
[Linkedin Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) using its HTTP API.

Supported _Cruise Control_ versions: **2.5.x-2.5.93** (tested with v2.5.86)

## How to use it

```shell
go get github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control@latest
```

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control/client"
	"github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control/api"
)

func main() {
    // Initializing Cruise Control client with default configuration
    cruisecontrol, err := client.NewDefaultClient()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    
    // Assembling the request using default values
    req := api.StateRequestWithDefaults()
    // Sending the request to the State API
    resp, err := cruisecontrol.State(req)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    // Getting the state of the Executor
    fmt.Println(resp.Result.ExecutorState.State)
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

* golang `1.18`
* docker
* docker-compose

### Development environment

Starting local development environment

```shell
make env-up
```

Tearing down the local development environment

```shell
make env-clean
```

### Testing

Running integration tests creates a new test environment prior executing the test suite and tears down at the end.

```shell
make integration-test
```

Set the `USE_EXISTING=true` environment variable if reusing the existing development/test environment
for integration testing is the desired behaviour.

```shell
export USE_EXISTING=true
make integration-test
```
