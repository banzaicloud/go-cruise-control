It's client library (written in Golang) for interacting with
[Linkedin Cruise Control](https://github.com/linkedin/cruise-control) using its HTTP API.

Supported _Cruise Control_ versions: **2.5.94+** (tested with v2.5.101)

## How to use it

```shell
go get github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control@latest
```

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control/client"
	"github.com/banzaicloud/go-cruise-control/api"
)

func main() {
	// Initializing Cruise Control client with default configuration
	cruisecontrol, err := client.NewDefaultClient()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Create Context with timeout
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30 * time.Second)
	defer cancel() 

	// Optionally set request Reason to Context which will sent to Cruise Control as part of the HTTP request
	ctx = client.ContextWithReason("example")

	// Assembling the request using default values
	req := api.StateRequestWithDefaults()

	// Sending the request to the State API
	resp, err := cruisecontrol.State(ctx, req)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Getting the state of the Executor
	fmt.Println(resp.Result.ExecutorState.State)
}
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

* golang `1.20.11`
* docker
* docker-compose

### Development environment

Starting local development environment

```shell
make start
```

Tearing down the local development environment

```shell
make stop
```

### Testing

Running integration tests creates a new test environment prior executing the test suite and tears down at the end.

```shell
make integration-test
```

Set the `USE_EXISTING=true` environment variable if reusing the existing development/test environment
for integration testing is the desired behaviour.

```shell
export USE_EXISTING=true
make integration-test
```
